 ## Mission

It's a beautiful Tuesday morning, you take a sip of your coffee while scrolling through a list of job opportunities. Suddenly, your phone rings, you don't hesitate and pick up, `Hello this is BeCode's bravest ones, how can I help you?` on other side, a piercing deep voice can be heard - `Hello, my name is Jean-Patrick Molard, I've heard that you and your team make professionally and quick websites for clients, I was hoping you could do the same for me.` 

Over the last years, Jean-Patrick has been releasing many designs for websites or applications & he succeed in his business. So much that he opened recently offices in Japan & Indonesia.
To mark the occasion, he decided to re-design his website & he would like you realize it. 
He already made the design on Figma that he will share with you. 
Your goal is to code this site, respecting the designer's mock-up, within a week. 

### The design

Here you'll find the **[FIGMA FILE](coach.md)**

Thanks to Figma, you can click and select different elements of the model and have an indication of each of them in the right column.


#### Sizes 
The different design sizes :
- Desktop: **1440 px** width
- Tablet portrait: **768 px** width
- Mobile: **375 px** width

You will have to manage the responsiveness how you think is the best.

**Advice** : Especially for the desktop, check the ["layout grid"](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows) of Figma to be sure to have the correct center width. 

#### Design system
The first layout in the Figma file is the design style guide. 
You'll find all the basics informations about typo, colors, buttons effects.. here. 

#### Mobile menu
On mobile view, you'll notice there is a hamburger menu. The menu sets on the last template. 

#### Effects 
Jean-Patrick wants you to design some nice hover effects or animations as well. 
In Figma, he created the layouts with "Active" mention to show you the result of the hovers. 

There is no indication about the effects or animations. For this part, you will have to use your **creativity**.


## Instructions

Your mission is to build the front-end integration of the website. 

1. Observe the design carefully, you need to follow it strictly!
1. The website has to be responsive.
1. The website has to respond to the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Tips and Tricks
